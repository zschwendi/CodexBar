# Moonshot / Kimi Open Platform provider

Moonshot / Kimi Open Platform is API-only. Balance is reported by `GET /v1/users/me/balance`,
so CodexBar only needs a valid API key to show the current account balance.

The native fetcher remains authoritative because this balance-only result is intentionally represented in snapshot
identity without a rate window, cost, or detail, while the plugin contract rejects identity-only snapshots.

## Rationale

Kimi API docs use the Moonshot API surface for current Kimi models: examples read
`MOONSHOT_API_KEY` and call `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1`, including the Kimi K2.6
quickstart. This provider is therefore named after the account and billing surface,
not a specific Kimi model version.

CodexBar uses the official Moonshot account and billing surface rather than unofficial
third-party Kimi relays.

## Data sources

1. **API key** stored in `~/.codexbar/config.json` or supplied via `MOONSHOT_API_KEY` / `MOONSHOT_KEY`.
   CodexBar binds saved keys to the selected regional host. Switching regions does not send the saved key to
   the other host; switch back or replace it with a key issued for the newly selected region.
2. **Region**
   - International: `https://api.moonshot.ai/v1/users/me/balance`
   - China mainland: `https://api.moonshot.cn/v1/users/me/balance`
   - Configure with Settings → Providers → Moonshot → API region or `MOONSHOT_REGION`.
   - Environment keys default to International. Set `MOONSHOT_REGION=china` alongside a China-issued key.
3. **Balance endpoint**
   - Request headers: `Authorization: Bearer <api key>`, `Accept: application/json`
   - Response contains `available_balance`, `voucher_balance`, and `cash_balance`.

## Usage details

- The menu card shows the available balance.
- Balances and deficits use the selected API region's currency: USD for International and CNY for China mainland. Amounts are displayed as returned by the API, without currency conversion.
- If `cash_balance` is negative, the card also surfaces the deficit.
- There is no session or weekly window — Moonshot / Kimi API does not expose per-window quota via API.
- Settings config takes precedence over environment variables when both are present.
