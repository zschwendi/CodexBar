# Command Code

CodexBar surfaces [Command Code](https://commandcode.ai) monthly USD credits next
to your other AI coding providers.

## Data source

- `https://api.commandcode.ai` billing endpoints, authenticated with the
  signed-in Command Code web session.
- The provider reads 5-hour and weekly rolling limits alongside monthly credit
  usage, plan allowance, remaining credits, and billing-cycle reset timing when
  the account data is available.

## Authentication

Command Code support uses browser cookies or a manually pasted cookie header.

1. Sign in to `https://commandcode.ai` in a supported browser.
2. Open Settings -> Providers -> Command Code.
3. Enable Command Code and leave Cookie source on Automatic, or switch to Manual
   and paste a `Cookie:` header/cURL capture from Command Code.

Automatic import looks for better-auth session cookies from `commandcode.ai`
and `www.commandcode.ai`. It tries each detected browser profile in order until
one authenticates, so stale cookies in an earlier browser do not mask a later
active session. If automatic import cannot find a session, use the manual cookie
field.

On Linux, browser import is unavailable. Set `cookieSource` to `manual` and
provide the Command Code `Cookie` header in `cookieHeader`; both `auto` and
`web` CLI source modes then use the billing API.

The monthly grant size comes from the optional subscription lookup, which can
time out while credits remain available. CodexBar keeps the last confirmed plan
in memory, scoped to the credential that produced it. A kept plan is dropped at `currentPeriodEnd`, a day
after the last refresh that confirmed it, when a lookup reports the free tier,
and when a lookup reports a plan this build cannot size. Nothing is written to
disk, so a one-shot `codexbar usage` run starts with an empty memory.

Debug builds accept `COMMANDCODE_API_URL` for synthetic tests against a loopback
origin (`localhost`, `127.0.0.1`, or `::1`). Release builds always use the official
billing endpoint.

## Display

- The menu bar item and provider card use the Command Code icon and label.
- The primary and secondary rows show 5-hour and weekly rolling usage.
- The tertiary row shows monthly credits used/remaining.
- The monthly row is sized from the kept plan when the subscription lookup fails,
  and from the fresh credits response in every case. With no kept plan the row is
  unavailable rather than shown as untouched, which is what a one-shot
  `codexbar usage` run reports after a failed lookup. The rolling rows stay
  available either way. The app also preserves an already-proven depleted monthly
  row while enrichment is unavailable and fresh credits still show depletion.
- Widgets do not expose Command Code in the provider picker yet.
