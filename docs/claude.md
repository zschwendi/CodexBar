# Claude provider

Claude supports three usage data paths plus local cost usage. The main provider pipeline uses runtime-specific
automatic selection, but the codebase still has multiple active Claude `.auto` decision sites while the refactor is
pending. For the exact current-state parity contract, see
[docs/refactor/claude-current-baseline.md](refactor/claude-current-baseline.md).

When an Anthropic Admin API key is configured, Claude can also show organization-level spend/messages/tokens in the
same inline dashboard pattern used by the OpenAI API provider.

## Data sources + selection order

### Default selection (debug menu disabled)
- If an Admin API key is configured, the Admin API strategy is used for Claude API spend/usage.
- App runtime main pipeline: OAuth API → CLI PTY → Web API.
- CLI runtime main pipeline: Web API → CLI PTY.
- Explicit picker modes (OAuth/Web/CLI) bypass automatic fallback.
- A lower-level direct Claude fetcher still contains a separate `.auto` order. That inconsistency is tracked in
  [docs/refactor/claude-current-baseline.md](refactor/claude-current-baseline.md).

Usage source picker:
- Preferences → Providers → Claude → Usage source (Auto/OAuth/Web/CLI).

Admin API key setup:
- Preferences → Providers → Claude → Admin API key, stored in `~/.codexbar/config.json`.
- CLI/env: `printf '%s' "$ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY" | codexbar config set-api-key --provider claude --stdin`.
- Token accounts can also hold `sk-ant-admin...` keys; they route to the Admin API instead of cookie/OAuth usage.
- Environment fallback: `ANTHROPIC_ADMIN_KEY`.

## Admin API
- Key prefix: `sk-ant-admin...`.
- Endpoints:
  - `/v1/organizations/cost_report`
  - `/v1/organizations/usage_report/messages`
- Output:
  - Today/7d/30d spend and message/token summaries.
  - Inline 30-day dashboard chart when daily buckets are present.
  - Identity login method: `Admin API`.

## Keychain prompt policy (Claude OAuth)
- Preferences → Providers → Claude → Keychain prompt policy.
- Options:
  - `Never prompt`: never attempts interactive Claude OAuth Keychain prompts.
  - `Only on user action` (default): interactive prompts are reserved for user-initiated repair flows.
  - `Always allow prompts`: allows interactive prompts in both user and background flows.
- This setting only affects Claude OAuth Keychain prompting behavior; it does not switch your Claude usage source.
- If Preferences → Advanced → Disable Keychain access is enabled, this policy remains visible but inactive until
  Keychain access is re-enabled.

### Debug selection (debug menu enabled)
- The Debug pane can force OAuth / Web / CLI.
- Web extras are internal-only (not exposed in the Providers pane).

## OAuth API (preferred)
- Credentials:
  - CodexBar OAuth cache when available.
  - File fallback: `~/.claude/.credentials.json`.
  - Claude CLI Keychain bootstrap/repair fallback: `Claude Code-credentials`.
- On Claude Code 2.1.x, `Claude Code-credentials` may contain only MCP server OAuth state (`mcpOAuth`) with no `claudeAiOauth`. CodexBar treats that as an OAuth configuration error, does not run background delegated `claude /status` refresh, and surfaces re-auth guidance. Use Web or CLI usage source, or restore a valid Claude OAuth keychain entry. See #1844.
- Requires `user:profile` scope (CLI tokens with only `user:inference` cannot call usage).
- Endpoints:
  - `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/usage`
  - `GET https://api.anthropic.com/api/oauth/profile` → account identity used to verify that optional Web enrichment
    belongs to the same Claude account.
- Headers:
  - `Authorization: Bearer <access_token>`
  - `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`
- Mapping:
  - `five_hour` → session window.
  - `seven_day` → weekly window; also becomes the primary fallback when `five_hour` is absent or has no utilization.
  - `seven_day_sonnet` / `seven_day_opus` → model-specific weekly window.
  - `limits[].weekly_scoped` → model-specific weekly windows; generic `All models` scopes stay in the main weekly row.
  - `seven_day_routines` / `seven_day_cowork` → Daily Routines extra window.
  - Claude Design/Omelette keys are ignored because Claude Design shares the main Claude usage limit.
  - `extra_usage` → Extra usage cost (monthly spend/limit).
- Preferences → Providers → Claude → Show Daily Routines usage hides only the Daily Routines row in menus and the
  provider preview. The global optional credits and extra usage setting is its master switch. The Claude-specific
  setting does not change fetching, history, notifications, widgets, model-scoped weekly limits, hooks, or CLI output.
- Preferences → Providers → Claude → Show model-specific weekly usage in widgets controls model-scoped weekly quota
  rows in desktop widgets. It is off by default; turning it on displays every known Claude window with a
  `claude-weekly-scoped-` identifier (for example, Fable). Turning it back off also drops scoped rows that a previous
  snapshot persisted. It does not change fetching, the menu, history, notifications, hooks, or CLI output.
- Successful OAuth login enables Claude and preserves the selected usage source. With the default Auto source, OAuth
  remains preferred when readable, while CLI/Web fallback stays available when OAuth credentials are not usable.
- Claude Code periodically rotates its `Claude Code-credentials` Keychain item and can replace the ACL grant that
  allowed CodexBar to read it. Auto treats that as a failed OAuth source, reuses a recent successful CLI result or
  continues to CLI/Web, and does not misreport the existing credentials as missing. A manual Refresh can re-grant
  Keychain access; selecting CLI or Web avoids the foreign-Keychain dependency.
- When every live Auto source fails, CodexBar keeps the last captured session/weekly percentages from
  `history/claude.json` visible as stale data and shows their capture age instead of blanking the quota bars.
  Restored history and CLI-scraped percentages both show “Limited usage detail”: the warning describes reduced
  fidelity, not the source of a historical capture. It does not change sign-in or refresh recovery actions.
- Plan inference: `subscriptionType` is preferred when present; `rate_limit_tier` falls back to
  Max/Pro/Team/Enterprise. When a Max `rate_limit_tier` carries a usage multiplier
  (`default_claude_max_5x` / `default_claude_max_20x`), it is surfaced in the label as "Max 5x" / "Max 20x".

## Web API (cookies)
- Preferences → Providers → Claude → Cookie source (Automatic or Manual).
- Manual mode accepts a `Cookie:` header from a claude.ai request.
- Multi-account manual tokens: add entries to `~/.codexbar/config.json` (`tokenAccounts`) and set Claude cookies to
  Manual. The menu can show all accounts stacked or a switcher bar (Preferences → Advanced → Display).
- Claude token accounts accept either `sessionKey` cookies or OAuth access tokens (`sk-ant-oat...`). OAuth-token
  accounts route to the OAuth path and disable cookie mode; session-key or cookie-header accounts stay in manual
  cookie mode. The exact edge-routing rules are documented in
  [docs/refactor/claude-current-baseline.md](refactor/claude-current-baseline.md).
- Cookie source order:
  1) Safari: `~/Library/Cookies/Cookies.binarycookies`
  2) Chrome/Chromium forks: `~/Library/Application Support/Google/Chrome/*/Cookies`
  3) Firefox: `~/Library/Application Support/Firefox/Profiles/*/cookies.sqlite`
- Domain: `claude.ai`.
- Cookie name required:
  - `sessionKey` (value prefix `sk-ant-...`).
- Cached cookies: Keychain cache `com.steipete.codexbar.cache` (account `cookie.claude`, source + timestamp).
  Reused before re-importing from browsers.
- API calls (all include `Cookie: sessionKey=<value>`):
  - `GET https://claude.ai/api/organizations` → org UUID.
  - `GET https://claude.ai/api/organizations/{orgId}/usage` → session/weekly/opus.
  - `GET https://claude.ai/api/organizations/{orgId}/overage_spend_limit` → Extra usage spend/limit.
  - `GET https://claude.ai/api/organizations/{orgId}/prepaid/credits` → remaining Usage credits balance.
  - `GET https://claude.ai/api/account` → email + plan hints.
- Outputs:
  - Session + weekly + model-specific percent used.
  - Daily Routines extra window when returned by the usage API.
  - Extra usage spend/limit (if enabled).
  - Remaining Usage credits balance (if enabled).
  - Account email + inferred plan.
- A Cloudflare challenge on `claude.ai` is a network-path restriction, not a stale-cookie signal. CodexBar keeps the
  cached cookie and prior quota snapshot, identifies the challenge, and links to Settings. Select OAuth for live
  quota windows on that network (the web-only Usage credits balance is unavailable), or try a different network.
  Explicit Web mode remains terminal and never reads OAuth credentials as a fallback.

## claude-swap accounts (opt-in)

The accepted multi-account design in
[claude-multi-account-and-status-items.md](claude-multi-account-and-status-items.md).

- Setup: Preferences → Providers → Claude → "Read accounts from claude-swap", then set the path to the
  [`cswap`](https://github.com/realiti4/claude-swap) executable (for example `~/.local/bin/cswap`).
- Version detection retries after a failed or cancelled startup probe; replaced refreshes cannot overwrite a newer
  result, and disabling the adapter or changing its executable clears the previous detected version.
- Behavior: on each Claude refresh, CodexBar runs `cswap --list --json` independently of the ambient Claude fetch (no
  shell, fixed arguments, bounded runtime and output), requires `schemaVersion == 1`, and parses only slot number,
  active state, usage status, email (display only), display-only `organizationName` (always present, may be empty),
  optional display-only `alias` when non-empty, the 5-hour/7-day windows, and optional display-only model-scoped
  weekly windows from `usage.scoped`. Identity stays `claude-swap:<slot>`; organization name and alias are never
  used as identity. When two or more slots share an email, cards append ` · organizationName` or ` · Account N`;
  a user-chosen cswap alias replaces that label. Unique emails stay email-only.
- Display: when claude-swap reports more than one account, the Claude menu and `codexbar cards` show one card per
  account (active account first, then numeric slot) instead of ambient/token-account Claude cards. With four or more
  accounts the app menu switches to a compact layout (`AccountMenuLayoutPlanner`): the active account keeps its full
  card, inactive accounts become one-line rows sorted by remaining headroom (most constrained first, red/amber below
  50%/10% left, a star on the healthiest activatable account), and healthy rows fold behind a "N more accounts ready"
  summary row. Clicking a compact row expands that account's full card for the current menu session; the summary row
  reveals the hidden rows. `codexbar cards` keeps the full per-account output. The same compact layout applies to
  every stacked multi-account list (token accounts on any provider, and flat Codex account lists; workspace-grouped
  Codex lists keep their sectioned stacked layout). To use this
  presentation with one account, enable “Show account card when only one account is available” or set
  `claudeSwapShowSingleAccount: true` on the Claude provider in the resolved config file (normally
  `~/.config/codexbar/config.json`; legacy installs may use `~/.codexbar/config.json`). The option defaults off,
  zero accounts still use the ambient presentation, and account identity is `claude-swap:<slot>`, never the display
  email.
- Terminal scope: this automatic precedence is cards-only and works on every supported CLI platform. An explicit
  Claude provider or `--source auto` remains eligible, while `--account`, `--account-index`, `--all-accounts`, and
  explicit non-auto source flags bypass the adapter. `codexbar usage` and serve `/usage`/`/cost` remain unchanged,
  while `codexbar dashboard` and `GET /dashboard/v1/snapshot` additionally nest one entry per swap account in the
  Claude provider row, with full identity by default or redacted email local parts when `--identity redacted` is set.
- Isolation: CodexBar never reads claude-swap or Claude Code credential storage for this feature; the
  subprocess handles its own credential access. In the app, adapter failures keep the last successful accounts as
  stale data, surface the error in provider settings, and never affect the ambient Claude usage card. In terminal
  cards, a list failure retains the current ambient output, adds a distinct `Claude (claude-swap)` footer entry, and
  exits non-zero.
- Sentinel statuses (`token_expired`, `api_key`, `keychain_unavailable`, `no_credentials`,
  and unknown future values) render as per-account notes instead of usage bars in both full and brief cards. When
  `unavailable` means claude-swap deferred polling because a window is at 100%, CodexBar keeps that slot's last
  projected usage bars and names the exhausted window (5-hour session, 7-day weekly, and/or a scoped model such as
  Fable) plus its reset time — not "Usage fetch failed." A first refresh that is already `unavailable` with no
  retained windows still notes that polling is deferred. Active rows are marked `[active]`; no claude-swap row infers
  a plan badge.
- Switching: an inactive account with usable source credentials shows “Switch Account…”. Clicking it runs exactly
  `cswap --switch-to <slot> --json`, validates the versioned result and requested slot, then refreshes both ambient
  Claude usage and every claude-swap account card. Switches are serialized; no automatic switching occurs. While
  claude-swap owns account presentation, the separate ambient OAuth action reads “Sign in with Claude Code…” and does
  not add or switch a claude-swap account.
- Expired, missing, unknown, or Keychain-inaccessible credentials stay non-actionable. A failed switch remains visible
  on that account without discarding its last successful usage. A running Claude Code process can take up to the
  claude-swap Keychain cache interval to observe the new account.
- Multiple claude-swap accounts—and a single account when explicitly enabled—take precedence over Claude
  token-account presentation (stacked cards and the segmented switcher).

## CLI PTY (fallback)
- Runs `claude` in a PTY session (`ClaudeCLISession`).
- Default behavior: exit after each probe; Debug → "Keep CLI sessions alive" keeps it running between probes.
- Probe working directory: `~/Library/Application Support/CodexBar/ClaudeProbe` with local Claude settings that disable
  deep-link URL handler registration during headless probes.
- After transient probes exit, CodexBar removes Claude Code `.jsonl` session artifacts for that dedicated
  `ClaudeProbe` project directory so background `/usage` polling does not clutter the user's Claude project history.
- Command flow:
  1) Start CLI with `--allowed-tools ""` (no tools).
  2) Auto-respond to first-run prompts (trust files, workspace, telemetry).
  3) Send `/usage`, wait for rendered panel; send Enter retries if needed.
  4) Optionally send `/status` to extract identity fields.
- Parsing (`ClaudeStatusProbe`):
  - Strips ANSI, locates "Current session" + "Current week" headers.
  - Extracts percent left/used and reset text near those headers.
  - When a reset date cannot be parsed, the menu preserves its description and normalizes leading `Reset` or `Resets` labels once, including scoped weekly limits.
  - Parses `Account:` and `Org:` lines when present.
  - A successful CLI quota read keeps the menu's Switch Account action even when optional identity fields are absent. Restored history and failed refreshes do not count as a successful sign-in.
  - Surfaces CLI errors (e.g. token expired) directly.
  - Some Education and organization-managed subscriptions return only a subscription notice, with no numeric
    session or weekly quota fields. CodexBar reports those limits as unavailable, keeps local cost/token history
    visible, and never derives quota percentages from spend or token totals.

## Cost usage (local log scan)
- Source roots:
  - Native Claude logs:
    - `$CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR` (comma-separated), each root uses `<root>/projects`.
    - Fallback roots:
      - `~/.config/claude/projects`
      - `~/.claude/projects` (Claude Code and current Claude Desktop Code/Cowork CLI sessions)
      - Additional embedded Claude Desktop project stores, when present:
        - `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/local-agent-mode-sessions/**/.claude/projects`
        - `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude-code-sessions/**/.claude/projects`
    - Current Claude Desktop metadata under `claude-code-sessions` points to shared CLI session JSONL by
      `cliSessionId`; metadata-only directories are not treated as usage sources.
  - Supported pi-compatible sessions:
    - `~/.pi/agent/sessions/**/*.jsonl`
    - `~/.omp/agent/sessions/**/*.jsonl`
- Files: `**/*.jsonl` under the native project roots, discovered Claude Desktop project roots,
  plus supported pi-compatible session files.
- Parsing:
  - Native Claude logs parse lines with `type: "assistant"` and `message.usage`.
  - Uses per-model token counts (input, cache read/create, output).
  - Deduplicates streaming chunks by `message.id + requestId` (usage is cumulative per chunk).
  - pi and OMP sessions attribute `anthropic` assistant usage to Claude and bucket it by assistant-turn timestamp, so a
    single pi-compatible session can contribute to multiple models/days.
  - Matching assistant entry IDs within the same session are counted once across roots; distinct turns are retained.
- Cache:
  - Native provider cache: `~/Library/Caches/CodexBar/cost-usage/claude-v6.json`
  - pi-compatible session cache: `~/Library/Caches/CodexBar/cost-usage/pi-sessions-v7.json`
